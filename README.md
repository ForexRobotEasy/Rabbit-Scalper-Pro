## Code Explanation

### Libraries and Functions
The code includes the necessary libraries and functions required for trading using the MQL5 platform.

```mql5
#include <Trade\Trade.mqh>
#include <Trade\PositionInfo.mqh>
```

### Constants
The code defines two constants:
- `TP_MULTIPLIER` - Take Profit multiplier
- `SL_MULTIPLIER` - Stop Loss multiplier

```mql5
#define TP_MULTIPLIER 1.5
#define SL_MULTIPLIER 2
```

### Global Variables
The code declares two global variables:
- `CTrade trade` - An instance of the `CTrade` class used for trading operations.
- `CPositionInfo positionInfo` - An instance of the `CPositionInfo` class used for accessing position-related information.

```mql5
CTrade trade;
CPositionInfo positionInfo;
```

### Initialization
The `OnInit()` function is called during the initialization of the EA. It sets the trading parameters such as the expert magic number, stop loss, and take profit.

```mql5
void OnInit()
{
   // Set trading parameters
   trade.SetExpertMagicNumber(123456);
   trade.SetStopLoss(30);
   trade.SetTakeProfit(20);
}
```

### Trading Logic
The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick of the market. It checks if there is an open position. If there is no open position, it places a new order using the `Buy()` function.

```mql5
void OnTick()
{
   // Check if there is an open position
   if (!positionInfo.IsPositionOpen())
   {
      // Place a new order
      trade.Buy(0.1);
   }
   else
   {
      // Check if the position is profitable
      if (positionInfo.GetProfit() > 0)
      {
         // Modify the take profit level
         double takeProfit = positionInfo.GetTakeProfit();
         double newTakeProfit = takeProfit * TP_MULTIPLIER;
         trade.ModifyTakeProfit(newTakeProfit);
      }
      else
      {
         // Modify the stop loss level
         double stopLoss = positionInfo.GetStopLoss();
         double newStopLoss = stopLoss * SL_MULTIPLIER;
         trade.ModifyStopLoss(newStopLoss);
      }
   }
}
```

### Resource Cleanup
The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the EA is being deinitialized. It cleans up any resources used by the EA.

```mql5
void OnDeinit(const int reason)
{
   trade.Deinit();
   positionInfo.Deinit();
}
```
